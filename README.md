# PCAP-Feature-Extraction

There are two scripts in this repository - convert_PCAP_to_JSON_Final. sh and parse_Streams_Final

The Script to parse streams take in a packet capture as input, and outputs multiple files, per TCP and UDP flow. 

Then, the conversion Script takes the multiple PCAP files, and converts them to JSON files.

Use cases of the JSON files include:
  - Analysis for Big Data
  - Extract features for prediction in a Machine Learning algorithm
